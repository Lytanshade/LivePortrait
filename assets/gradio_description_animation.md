<span style="font-size: 1.2em;">ðŸ”¥ To animate the source portrait with your own driving video, please follow these steps:</span>
<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;">
1. In the <strong>Animation Options</strong> section, we recommend enabling the <strong>crop (source)</strong> option if face occupies a small portion of your image.
</div>
<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;">
2. Press the <strong>ðŸš€ Animate</strong> button. Your animated video will appear in the results block. This may take a few moments.

If you want to create your own driving video, <strong>the best practices are</strong>:

 - Crop to a 1:1 aspect ratio (e.g., 512x512 or 256x256 pixels), or enable auto-cropping by checking the `crop (driving video)` option.
 - Focus on the head area, similar to the example videos.
 - Minimize shoulder movement.
 - Faces moving forward and backward (Z-axis) tend to make for very poor driving videos.
 - Try to have the first frame of the driving video showing a full frontal face with a **neutral expression**.
 - You can use the <strong>âœ‚ Trim</strong> button on the video input window to select the perfect starting frame and cut the video to size.

<p></div> <div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;"> Try the <strong>lip-zero</strong> option if your animated image has mouth issues... it's also a fun option for changing the results. </div></p>

<p></div> <div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Stitching and Relative Motion </strong> options have situational uses, but best left on default and ignored. </div></p>
