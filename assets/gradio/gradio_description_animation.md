<span style="font-size: 1.2em;">ðŸ”¥ To animate the source portrait or video with the driving video, please follow these steps:</span>
<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;">
1. In the <strong>Animation Options</strong> section, we recommend enabling the <strong>crop (source)</strong> option if faces occupy a small portion of your image.

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;">
2. Press the <strong>ðŸš€ Animate</strong> button and wait for a moment. Your animated video will appear in the result block. This may take a few moments.

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;">
3. If you want to upload your own driving video, <strong>the best practice</strong>:

 - Crop it to a 1:1 aspect ratio (e.g., 512x512 or 256x256 pixels), or enable auto-crop by checking `crop (driving video)`.
 - Focus on the head area, similar to the example videos.
 - Minimize shoulder movement.
 - Make sure the first frame of driving video is a frontal face with **neutral expression**.

**Note:**
*If the input is a source video, the length of the animated video is the minimum of the length of the source video and the driving video.
*In the <strong>Animation Options for Driving Video</strong> section, the <code>relative head rotation</code> and <code>smooth strength</code> options only take effect if the source input is a video.
*Audio is currently only sourced from the <strong>Driving Video</strong>. Update coming soon to allow to choose Source Video audio.
